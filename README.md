##Introduction
Stock price prediction is a challenging task in the field of finance. This project explores the use of LSTM, ANN, and linear regression models to predict stock prices based on historical data. The goal is to provide insights and predictions that can assist investors in making informed decisions.

##Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your system. Additionally, you'll need to install the following libraries:
1.numpy
2.pandas
3.scikit-learn
4.tensorflow
5.keras

##Models
This project utilizes three different models for stock price prediction:
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM): LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is well-suited for sequence prediction tasks. It can capture long-term dependencies in the input data and has been successful in predicting stock prices.
Artificial Neural Network (ANN): ANN is a feedforward neural network that consists of multiple layers of interconnected nodes. It can learn complex patterns in the input data and has been widely used for stock price prediction.
Linear Regression: Linear regression is a simple yet effective model for predicting continuous values. It assumes a linear relationship between the input features and the target variable.

##Data
The project uses historical stock price data obtained from a reliable financial data source. The dataset includes features such as opening price, closing price, volume, etc. The data is preprocessed and split into training and testing sets.

##Results
The performance of each model is evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE). The results are presented in graphical form and compared to the actual stock prices.
